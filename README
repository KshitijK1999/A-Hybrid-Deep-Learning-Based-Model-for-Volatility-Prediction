This study investigates the advantage of combining the forecasting abilities of multiple well
known generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-type models such
as the standard GARCH (sGARCH), exponential GARCH (eGARCH), and threshold
GARCH (tGARCH) models with advanced deep learning models to analyze and predict the
volatility dynamics of four important non-ferrous metals (Nickel, Copper, Tin, and Lead) in
the Indian commodity market. This paper proposes integrating the forecasts of one to three
GARCH-type models into ensemble learning-based hybrid LSTM (long short-term memory)
models to forecast commodity price volatility. We further evaluate the forecasting
performance of these models with respect to standalone LSTM and GARCH-type models in
terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) to confirm that the addition of GARCH model forecasts can
significantly improve overall forecast accuracy. The results suggest that combining the
information from multiple GARCH-types into a hybrid LSTM model can indeed lead to
superior volatility forecasting capability, with the SET-LSTM, which represents the model
that combines forecasts of the sGARCH, eGARCH, and tGARCH into the LSTM hybrid,
showing the best overall results for all metals, barring a few exceptions. Moreover, the
Diebold-Mariano and Wilcoxon signed rank tests are applied for checking the
equivalence of forecasting accuracy.
