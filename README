The problem of time series forecasting has always been an challenge for the financial community. The major problem with time series analysis is the problem of non
staionarity in the data and the lack of trend and seasonality in Financial data. This paper studies the applicability of popular econometric and deep neural networks 
as forecasters for non stationary financial time series data. We evaluate the volatility of Copper and Tin two of the most important non ferrous metals of India using 
several Econometric models like sGARCH (Standard Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity), EGARCH (Exponential GARCH) and TGARCH (Threshold GARCH). We also employ 
different LSTM ( Long short-term memory) models which are a sub model of the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). These models are evaluated over the following two metals using 
15 years of Financial Time series data. Single step forecasting for several window sizes was used to check the forecast accuracy of the LSTM models. In the study we also 
attempt to apply the multiple variations of the GARCH model and combine it with the LSTM models to compare the predictions of the hybrid models with the single input 
based models. By comparing the values of four different types of loss functions we can observe that the traditional GARCH models have a  really poor prediction power 
while the LSTM and hybrid LSTM models have a much superior predictability. On average the hybrid models are found to perform better than the single input RNN models when 
evaluated on longer window sizes periods while the single input models perform better on shorter window sizes.
